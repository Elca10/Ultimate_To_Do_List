*** PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ITS VERY BEGINNING STAGES, AND AS A RESULT, IS INCOMPLETE. ***

<><> A BRIEF DESRIPTION <><>
The Ultimate To-Do List is essentially an upgraded to-do list. Although visually quite simple, it gives the user more control over their to-do list by providing an extensive array of 'actions' for the user to make.

<><> SOME THINGS TO FIX <><>
- fix printing item instead of category [action 9]
- check alphabetical sorting (and other sorting methods) [action 3.4]
- make sure 'complete' items are not visible and are not showing [action 4]
- fix issues that arise from running multiple actions at once
- save user data AFTER an action
- make lists start at the top, not the center
- fix the general question/entry box pair positioning

<><> IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE <><>
- Intro tutorial
- Suggest a schedule for the day based on Google calendar (using API) and due dates/quantity of tasks
- Email report to user at end of day (completed tasks, unfinished, etc.)
- Record and show time spent on a task, then use the data to predict completion times for similar tasks
- Color code items based on category
- Email notifications about items due soon, add deadlines to calendar
- Calendar view (show tasks on a calendar based on due date)
- Have multiple ‘pages’ if/when tasks cannot fit on one screen
- More sorting abilities
- 'Scrolling' feature on both left and right sides
- Delete category action
- Timer/stopwatch for timing work on items
- Pomodoro work mode option
- If user has a job, 'clocks in/out' or at least shows how much time and when to clock in
- Customizable appearance
- More user friendly interface (clicking on desired action, rather than entering a number), dragging items from lists, etc.
